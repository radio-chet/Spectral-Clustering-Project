# Spectral-Clustering-Project
Spectral clustering is an technique that reduces complex multidimensional data
sets into clusters of similar data in rarer dimensions. The main outline is to
cluster the all spectrum of unorganized data points into multiple groups based upon
their uniqueness.Spectral Clustering uses the connectivity approach to clusteringâ€™,
wherein communities of nodes (i.e., data points) that are connected or immediately
next to each other are identified in a graph. The nodes are then mapped to a
low-dimensional space that can be easily segregated to form clusters. Spectral
Clustering uses information from the eigenvalues (spectrum) of special matrices
(i.e., Affinity Matrix, Degree Matrix and Laplacian Matrix) derived from the graph
or the data set.
